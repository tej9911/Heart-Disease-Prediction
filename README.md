Welcome to the **Heart Disease Predictor**! 🏥💖 This is a simple yet powerful machine learning model deployed using **Streamlit** to help predict heart disease risk based on user input. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Easy-to-use UI** 🖥️: Powered by **Streamlit**, making predictions seamless and interactive.
- **Machine Learning Model** 🧠: Uses a trained model to assess heart disease risk.
- **Real-Time Input & Output** ⏳: Just enter the required values and get an instant prediction!
- **Health Metrics** 📊: Inputs include age, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, and more.
- **Quick Deployment** 🚀: Just run the script and start predicting!

## 🛠️ Installation
Make sure you have **Python** installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy streamlit pickle-mixin
```

## 📌 How to Run
Simply clone the repository and run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Model**: A pre-trained ML model is loaded from a `.pkl` file.
- **Dataset**: Uses `heartprediction.csv` for data-driven insights.
- **Framework**: **Streamlit** for the front-end interface.
